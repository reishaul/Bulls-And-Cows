The algorithm is for an automatic method to guess a correct number by using feedback from functions. It counts the number of guesses needed to find the correct answer. A loop runs until the correct number is guessed, calling functions to refine the guesses.

One function, removeOptions, calls checkIfTrue, which in turn calls InfoFromArrays. InfoFromArrays checks if a guess matches the number in terms of "bulls" and "cows" (correct digits in correct and incorrect positions) and returns an array with these counts. checkIfTrue compares these counts to the original numbers; if they match, it confirms the guess as valid. Otherwise, it marks the guess as incorrect, so itâ€™s not repeated.

With each loop iteration, a function updates the guess to get closer to the correct answer. This continues until the correct code is found and the game ends.
